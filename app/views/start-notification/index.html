Use this form to begin the legal process of notifying Acas that you want:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>a certificate to make a claim to an employment tribunal</li>
<li>early conciliation - where Acas speaks with you and your employer separately to try and resolve the problem without going to an employment tribunal

Check you’ve followed the right steps before starting.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
Step 1: Check your time limit
</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
You usually have 3 months minus 1 day to notify Acas. This will depend on the type of work problem you have. <a href="#" class="govuk-link">Find out when your time limit starts</a>.
</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
Step 2: Check you’ve followed the right procedure with your employer

Problems at work can often be resolved by <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/how-to-raise-a-problem-at-work" class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">speaking with your employer</a>.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">

What early conciliation is</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">
Early conciliation is a free service where Acas speaks with you and your employer separately to:
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
help you reach an agreement
avoid you having to go to an employment tribunal
</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
The benefits
</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Early conciliation is much quicker and less stressful than going to an employment tribunal because it:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
lasts a maximum of 6 weeks - you can wait up to 1 year for a tribunal hearing</li>
<li>can help keep a good relationship with your employer</li>
<li>gives you a wider choice of outcomes than a tribunal, and they’re still legally binding</li>
