      Check you’ve followed the right steps before starting.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Step 1: Check your time limit
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      You usually have 3 months minus 1 day to notify Acas. This will depend on the type of work problem you have.

    </p>

      Step 2: Check you’ve followed the right procedure with your employer
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Problems at work can often be resolved by
      <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/how-to-raise-a-problem-at-work" class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">speaking with your employer
      </a>.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Before starting the form you should have either:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/grievance-procedure-step-by-step" class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">raised a grievance

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      If you did not try to resolve the problem with your employer
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      You could lose up to 25% of any compensation you might receive if you make a claim to an employment tribunal.
    </p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Step 3: Decide if you want early conciliation
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Most claims are settled through Acas conciliation rather than at an employment tribunal.
    </p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      What early conciliation is
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Early conciliation is a free service where Acas speaks with you and your employer separately to:
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      help you reach an agreement
      avoid you having to go to an employment tribunal
    </p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      The benefits
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">Early conciliation is much quicker and less stressful than going to an employment tribunal because it:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        lasts a maximum of 6 weeks - you can wait up to 1 year for a tribunal hearing
      </li>
      <li>can help keep a good relationship with your employer
      </li>
      <li>gives you a wider choice of outcomes than a tribunal, and they’re still legally binding
      </li>
    </ul>
