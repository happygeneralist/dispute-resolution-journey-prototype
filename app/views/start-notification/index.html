What early conciliation is</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">
Early conciliation is a free service where Acas speaks with you and your employer separately to:
</p>

help you reach an agreement

  <li>
lasts a maximum of 6 weeks - you can wait up to 1 year for a tribunal hearing</li>
<li>can help keep a good relationship with your employer</li>
<li>gives you a wider choice of outcomes than a tribunal, and they’re still legally binding</li>
